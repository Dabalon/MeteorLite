# MeteorLite

An Old School RuneScape third party client that uses JavaFX, a modified openosrs-injector to inject
directly to runescape-client as well as a Sponge Mixins Instrumentation agent for runtime injection.

There is also an optional task ```decompileInjected```, that will decompile the injected client into
the ```injected-client``` module.  
After that, you can use breakpoint functionality / IDE debugging features against the injected
client.
